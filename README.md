## How To Run

Please use the following commands to run the program. You need to have Ruby installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/heidiseo/robotic-hoover.git
cd robotic-hoover
ruby main.rb <path-to-file>
```

## Algorithm Design
Two dimensional array representing the room is used because it allows the constant time check wheter the current position of the robotic hoover is the same as where a dirt is.
